## Welcome!
18F is partnering with the United Sytates Forest Service on an [Experiment & Iterate](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/) project focused on timber permitting. This repo contains documentation describing the project. To learn about the project, what it can do, and why it's important, **[head to our project wiki](https://github.com/18F/USFS-timber-permitting/wiki)**. The wiki is designed to help the project team keep track of the overall project goals, progress to date, and learnings as we work. It is also intended to be a project landing page where stakeholders can access important and up-to-date project information.
